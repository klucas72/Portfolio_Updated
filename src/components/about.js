                <p>Born and raised in rural Illinois, I graduated high
                    school and started college in the nearby college town
                    of Terre Haute, Indiana. There I completed my Bachelor's
                    of Science in Medical Technology. I interned at a
                    hospital just outside of Chicago where I performed and
                    ran laboratory tests ordered by physicians and nurses
                    at area hospitals. Tired of the cold and harsh winters,
                    I applied and was accepted as a United States Naval Medical
                    Service Corps Officer in the United States Navy.
                    For officer training school and indoctronation, I was
                    sent to the Naval Training Center in Newport Rhode Island.
                    From there, I was stationed in San Diego, California for
                    one four year tour. I left the Navy after one tour and
                    lived in San Diego for about 10 years before I moved to
                    Atlanta. While in Atlanta, I went back to school and
                    received another Bachelor's of Science in Network
                    Communications and Engineering. With my combined
                    experience as a Medical Technologist and a Network
                    Engineer, I have been working for a Medical Device/Biomedical
                    company here in Atlanta for the last 8 years. This position
                    has allowed me to travel the world and work with citizens
                    from various countries and cultures. Now, I am working
                    on gaining experience and becoming a full stack developer
                    where it will hopefully help me push my career forward
                    to new and different areas of my life and work.</p>
