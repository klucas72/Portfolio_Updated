                <p>Born and raised in rural Illinois, I graduated high school and started college in the nearby college town of Terre Haute, Indiana. There I completed my Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Medical Technology. I went back to school in 2007 and received another BS in Network Communications and Technology. Information technology has always been a hobby and something I enjoy in my spare time and love to learn more about all aspects of it.  So I made it my career.  So, while working for a Medical Device/Biomedical company here in Atlanta for the last 8 years, I wanted to expand my skills into coding and programming.  Learning these skills has been a challenge and a source of enjoyment for me.  This is why I am now working becoming a full stack developer.  Building web sites and mobile applications has provided me with a challenge and a desire to learn more.  I have found learning the various coding languages to be fun and stimulating.  </p>
